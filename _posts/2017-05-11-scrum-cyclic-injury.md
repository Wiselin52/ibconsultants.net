As promised in my previous article wanted to write tonight about cyclic injuries.

<strong>Goal#3 Avoid Cyclic Injury</strong>

I hear that the new Gym subscriptions soar high right after a new year day, like many others I fell for it. Soon I had a lower back injury and was lectured by my physician about cyclic injury and the severity of exercise injuries if not done properly.

We live in a world where a physical injury is treated with utmost care and sometimes it is even taboo to talk about the injuries that occur to the brain, which controls the whole human system. We in the IT industry being knowledge workers should understand the peril of constant stress we apply to our nervous system.

In the spirit of delivering faster value to our stakeholders we sometime don’t realize that we stretch ourselves in a two week sprint only to keep repeating it all through the year. Though our sprint velocity is supposed to be designed for a sustained pace we most often realize that it’s far from reality. There is a bunch of controls and checks we as scrum masters and coaches can put in place to to make sure things don't go crazy.

I am tired of hearing tales of how long night work calls impacts a healthy life. Distributed teams add to the challenge and if not properly handled it can manifest in many forms which affects the work life balance in most cases leading to attention deprived families.

Many knowledge workers also show symptoms of insomnia or disturbed sleep patterns as shown by their Fitbit apps. The reason to this is no surprise to those who listened to their science teacher’s talk about inertia of bodies (mind) in motion

Rotation of roles and responsibilities or technical skills also is a good way to nurture the health of the brain. Doing the same work chores every day for an extended period can diminish the potency of the brain. Hence emphasizing the importance of developing T Shaped skills. Lastly there is no better food for the brain then lifelong continuing education. Like a carpenter has a tool box we as knowledge workers should make sure we equip and train our brain with the latest tools and techniques.

Will see you soon in my future articles on Digitize me.~~~~Wiselin
