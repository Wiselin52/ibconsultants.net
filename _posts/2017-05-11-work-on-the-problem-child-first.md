<strong>Goal 5: Take the Bull by the horn!</strong>

What life has taught me so far is that wherever there is a problem there is an opportunity. When we do agile transformations in enterprises, I often see that management wants to pilot new methodologies on good performing teams before they decide to roll out.

I would challenge all the coaches out there to influence leaders and take the bull by the horn by working on troubled teams first. This would actually help in faster enterprise transformation.

Please remember that a chain is only as strong as the weakest link.
