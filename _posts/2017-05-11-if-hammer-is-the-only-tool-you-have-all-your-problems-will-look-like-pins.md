While we as Agile coaches and leaders would like to make our systems leaner, cheaper, faster; we should be careful on using the right tool for the right purpose.

<strong>Goal #4: Use the right tool</strong>
<blockquote>Scrum is not the only Agile tool</blockquote>
To start with we should understand that Scrum in only one for the many Agile tools. I see that many use the terms interchangeably. Some of the other prominent tools out there are Six Sigma, XP, TDD, FDD, Kanban, etc.

I see that scrum methodology is one of the most hyped terms in management these days that most companies think that they might left out if they donâ€™t adopt it. Like in my last article I said that like a carpenter has many tools and he chooses the right tool for the right purpose.

We as Agile coaches should make sure that we use the right tool for the right problem. If proper care is not taken, we might end up hindering the goal rather than accelerating it. ~~~ Wiselin
