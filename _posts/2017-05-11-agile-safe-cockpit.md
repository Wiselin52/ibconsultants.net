<strong>Goal 6: Believe in Data, metrics and data driven decisions</strong>

Being a Data Scientist myself I believe in metrics and data driven decisions. My key takeaway of my six years of research for my PhD is that anything can be quantified and that the data tells a story if we collect the right information and ask the right statistical questions.

I have been practicing and training folks on the Scaled Agile framework (SAFe) for nearly half a decade now. Here is a <a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/metrics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">link</a> which summarizes all the key metrics.

Baseline and monitor Agile Transformation

It is important that you baseline your agile transformation initiatives and monitor the progress of various metrics at various levels (Team, Program, Value Stream, Portfolio and Enterprise)

Don't do a metric overdose

Make sure you communicate the right metrics to the right folks and don't forget to train your audience.

Capture end to end system metrics

With the invent of DevOps and its integration with various Tools like Jira, CA Agile Central (Rally), Version One, etc we are able to capture the end to end metrics from the inception to delivery. We should also take a step further and quantify the actual value delivered once the delivery has happened.

Automate your metrics

I have seen many painfully do a manual metrics every day that most of the time is spent on doing it rather than taking any meaningful action out of it.

Don't use story points to compare two teams

Going to basics, if you truly understand what story points are and what it is supposed to be used for don't use it to compare two teams and also educate your management on the same. As it can have significant consequences.

Use System metrics to Eliminate Muda and reduce variance!

Once you have the end to end system metrics, identify statistically the Muda (bottle necks) and eliminate it (Lean). Effort should also be taken to avoid fluctuations or variance in system performance (Six Sigma).

My Favorite part of my job anywhere is to quantify and create a real time cockpit dashboard for the Senior management and the entire team so they can pilot their takeoff towards agility and continuous improvement.

Please get on board now that DATA is the new OIL! ~~~ Wiselin
