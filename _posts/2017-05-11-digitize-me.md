I have been working for nearly a decade and half to make enterprises Agile. Practice before your preach has driven me to do a bit of introspect.

This will be the first of a series of short articles which throws light on my findings which though sounds surprising, actually just reinforces the basics.

<strong>GOAL 1: Understand your Vision, Goal and Constraints</strong>

As per the theory of constraints if a system does not have constraints it will be delivering infinite value. I personally believe that everyone is a one person enterprise by themselves, dreaming to maximize their value, but to do it they have to overcome constraints.

The problem with many is that they either don’t have a clear vision to start with or they don’t understand their constraints. Constraints can manifest in many ways education, family, health, socioeconomic, exposure, etc. But I would like to call out that though everyone should have a vision it is ok to iterate their goals. Also it is important to stress that value need not be necessarily money.

Once we identify the constraints we should be working towards minimizing the impact of them to maximize the value. But it is fair to call out that some of the constraints can be controlled while others cannot be. But it is surprising how many of the constraints can be easily manipulated.

<strong>GOAL 2: Take a different Stair</strong>

An act becomes a habit and a habit becomes a character. Most of us likely have a routine. We get up around the same time, drive to work at around the same time, park around the same location, take the same stairs, and do the usual work chores only to repeat it the next day.

We are on a cruise mode and we do not do anything to create constructive instability in us. I would like to sign off this article by urging you to take a step in changing your routine. May be take a different stair to start with….

I will continue writing about this in my next article Cyclic Injury.~~~~~Wiselin
